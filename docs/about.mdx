## What is Context7?

Context7 is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that brings up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly into your AI coding assistant. It solves the fundamental problem of LLMs relying on outdated training data when generating code.

### The Problem

LLMs are trained on data that can be months or years old. This means:

- Code examples may use deprecated APIs
- Syntax might not match current library versions
- Best practices may have changed since training
- New features are completely unknown to the model

### The Solution

Context7 fetches current documentation from library sources in real-time and injects it into your LLM's context. When you ask for help with Next.js, React, or any other library, Context7 provides:

- **Current API references** - Documentation from the latest version
- **Working code examples** - Tested snippets that actually work
- **Version-specific guidance** - Pin to exact versions when needed
- **Best practices** - Updated recommendations from library authors

## Core Concepts

### Library IDs

Every library in Context7 has a unique identifier in the format `/owner/repo`. For example:

- `/vercel/next.js` - Next.js documentation
- `/facebook/react` - React documentation
- `/supabase/supabase` - Supabase documentation

You can also specify versions: `/vercel/next.js/v15.1.8`

### Documentation Modes

Context7 provides two types of documentation:

| Mode | Use Case | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Code** (default) | API references, implementation details | Code snippets, function signatures, usage examples |
| **Info** | Conceptual understanding, architecture | Guides, explanations, conceptual overviews |

### MCP Tools

Context7 exposes two main tools to your AI assistant:

1. **`resolve-library-id`** - Searches for libraries and returns their Context7-compatible IDs
2. **`get-library-docs`** - Fetches documentation for a specific library ID

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Documentation

Context7 continuously indexes documentation from thousands of open-source libraries. When you query for documentation:

1. Your topic keywords are sent to Context7 (your actual prompts stay local)
2. Relevant documentation snippets are retrieved from our indexed database
3. Fresh, accurate content is injected into your LLM's context

### 2. Version Pinning

Pin documentation to specific versions for consistent results:

```txt
Set up authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase/v2.0.0
```

This ensures you get documentation that matches your project's dependencies.

### 3. Topic Filtering

Focus results on specific topics to get more relevant documentation:

```txt
Show me Next.js middleware examples. use context7
```

The MCP server extracts "middleware" as a topic and returns documentation specifically about middleware.

### 4. Pagination

Context7 supports up to 10 pages of results per topic. If the initial context isn't sufficient:

1. The AI can request additional pages
2. Each page contains up to 10 documentation snippets
3. Pagination metadata helps track available content

### 5. Private Repositories

For Pro and Enterprise users, Context7 can index your private repositories:

- Internal libraries and frameworks
- Proprietary documentation
- Team-specific guides and patterns

### 6. Team Collaboration

Share Context7 access across your team:

- Centralized API key management
- Role-based access control
- Shared library allowlists
- Team usage analytics

### 7. Source Reputation

Each library includes quality indicators:

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trust Score** | Source authority (High, Medium, Low, Unknown) |
| **Benchmark Score** | Quality indicator (0-100, higher is better) |
| **Code Snippets** | Number of available code examples |

## Workflows

### Basic Usage

Add `use context7` to any coding prompt:

```txt
Create a Next.js API route that handles file uploads. use context7
```

The AI will:
1. Identify that Next.js documentation is needed
2. Call `resolve-library-id` to find `/vercel/next.js`
3. Call `get-library-docs` with topic "API routes file uploads"
4. Generate code based on current documentation

### Auto-Invoke Setup

Configure your AI assistant to automatically use Context7 without explicit prompts.

**Cursor** (`Cursor Settings > Rules`):
```txt
Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup steps, or library documentation.
Automatically use Context7 MCP tools without me having to ask.
```

**Windsurf** (`.windsurfrules`):
```txt
Use context7 for all code generation and API documentation questions.
```

**Claude Code** (`CLAUDE.md`):
```txt
Automatically use context7 for code generation and library documentation.
```

### Direct Library ID Usage

Skip the search step when you know the exact library:

```txt
Implement rate limiting using /upstash/ratelimit for my API endpoints.
```

The `/owner/repo` format tells Context7 exactly which library to fetch.

### Multi-Library Queries

Get documentation from multiple libraries in a single session:

```txt
Build a full-stack app with Next.js and Supabase authentication.
use library /vercel/next.js and /supabase/supabase
```

### Version-Specific Development

When working with specific library versions:

```txt
I'm using Next.js 14. Show me the App Router documentation.
use library /vercel/next.js/v14.3.0-canary.87
```

## Best Practices

### Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Management" icon="key">
    - Store keys in environment variables, never in code
    - Use `.env` files and add them to `.gitignore`
    - Create separate keys for different environments (dev, prod)
    - Rotate keys every 90 days or immediately if compromised
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Access Control" icon="users">
    - Use the Developer role for non-admin team members
    - Review and audit team access regularly
    - Remove access promptly when team members leave
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Specific Library IDs" icon="bullseye">
    Instead of: "Show me React hooks documentation"
    
    Use: "Show me hooks documentation. use library /facebook/react"
    
    Direct library IDs skip the search step and return results faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Topic Filtering" icon="filter">
    Be specific about what you need:
    
    - "authentication with JWT" instead of "auth"
    - "server components data fetching" instead of "data"
    - "middleware redirect patterns" instead of "middleware"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pagination Strategy" icon="book-open">
    Start with the default page, then request more if needed:
    
    1. Initial request returns page 1
    2. Check if context is sufficient
    3. Request page 2, 3, etc. if more detail is needed
    4. Maximum of 10 pages (100 snippets) per topic
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Caching" icon="database">
    For direct API usage:
    
    - Cache responses for 6-24 hours
    - Documentation updates are infrequent
    - Reduces API calls and improves response times
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Library Management
